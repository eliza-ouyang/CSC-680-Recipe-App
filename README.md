## Project Proposal
I decided to create a recipe app for my final project. Learning to cook while having little knowledge can be daunting, so I thought that a recipe app would help those who are learning to cook or enjoy cooking.

## Features
Must have features:
  - A home screen displaying all of the recipes
  - Allow the user(s) to add new recipes
  - Display and sort recipes by categories
  - Be able to search for specific recipes in collection

Nice to have features:
  - Be able to favorite/save recipes for later

All of the must have features have been implemented and didn't have enough time to implement a way to favorite recipes.
